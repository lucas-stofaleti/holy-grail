## Project Overview

This is a simple project where I built the [Holy Grail](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)>) CSS Layout using CSS Grid.

You can see the [final version here](https://zachgoll.github.io/holy-grail-css-layout/).

If you want to learn how to build the same you can check this [tutorial](https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/posts/2021/fullstack-developer-series/11-css-grid-crash-course/) from Zach.
